//Given an initial key frequency, output that frequency and the next 4 higher key frequencies.
//Output all frequencies with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put frequency to output with 5 decimal places

//Input
float frq
integer n
float r

frq = Get next input
r = RaiseToPower(2, (1.0/12.0))
Put frq to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

//Run 1
n = 1
Put frq  * RaiseToPower(r, n) to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

//Run 2
n = 2
Put frq  * RaiseToPower(r, n) to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

//Run 3
n = 3
Put frq  * RaiseToPower(r, n) to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

//Run 4
n = 4
Put frq  * RaiseToPower(r, n) to output with 5 decimal places
