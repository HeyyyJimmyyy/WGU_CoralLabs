//Write a program using integers userNum and x as input, and output userNum divided by x four times.

integer userNum
integer x
integer runOne
integer runTwo
integer runThree
integer runFour

userNum = Get next input
x = Get next input

runOne = userNum / x
runTwo = runOne / x
runThree = runTwo / x
runFour = runThree / x

Put runOne to output
Put " " to output
Put runTwo to output
Put " " to output
Put runThree to output
Put " " to output
Put runFour to output
