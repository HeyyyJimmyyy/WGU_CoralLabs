 //Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both floats) as input, and output the gas cost for 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles.
//Output the gas cost (gasCost) with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places

//Inputs
float mpg
float dollGal
float tripCost

//Milage Options
integer tenMiles
integer fiftyMiles
integer fourHunMiles
//output 
float gasCost

mpg = Get next input
dollGal = Get next input

tenMiles = 10
fiftyMiles = 50
fourHunMiles = 400

gasCost = dollGal / mpg * tenMiles
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
Put " " to output

gasCost = dollGal / mpg * fiftyMiles
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
Put " " to output

gasCost = dollGal / mpg * fourHunMiles
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
