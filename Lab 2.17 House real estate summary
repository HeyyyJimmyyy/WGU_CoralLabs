//Write a program with two inputs, current price and last month's price (both integers). 
//Then, output a summary listing the price, the change since last month, and the estimated monthly mortgage computed as (currentPrice * 0.045) / 12.
//Output the estimated monthly mortgage (estMortgage) with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put estMortgage to output with 2 decimal places

integer currPrice
integer lastMonthPrice
float estMortgage
integer changePrice

currPrice = Get next input
lastMonthPrice = Get next input
changePrice = currPrice - lastMonthPrice
estMortgage = (currPrice * 0.045 ) /12

Put "This house is $" to output
Put currPrice to output
Put "." to output
Put " The change is $" to output
Put changePrice to output
Put " since last month." to output
Put "\nThe estimated monthly mortgage is $" to output
Put estMortgage to output with 2 decimal places
Put "." to output
