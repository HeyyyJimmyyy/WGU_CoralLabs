//Given 3 integers, output their average and their product, using integer arithmetic.
//Using the same 3 integers, output the average and product, using floating-point arithmetic.
//Output all floating-point numbers with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put x to output with 5 decimal places

integer inOne
integer inTwo
integer inThr
integer avg
integer prod
float flOne
float flTwo
float flThr
float flAvg
float flProd

//Int
inOne = Get next input
inTwo = Get next input
inThr = Get next input

//Float
flOne  = inOne * 1.0
flTwo = inTwo * 1.0
flThr = inThr * 1.0

//Int Avg/Prod
avg = (inOne + inTwo + inThr) / 3
prod = inOne * inTwo * inThr

//Float Avg/Prod
flAvg = (flOne + flTwo + flThr) / 3
flProd = flOne * flTwo * flThr 

Put avg to output
Put " " to output
Put prod to output
Put "\n" to output
Put flAvg to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output
Put flProd to output with 5 decimal places
