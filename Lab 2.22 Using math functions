//Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output xy, x(yz), the absolute value of x, and the square root of ((x * y)z).
/Output all results with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put result to output with 5 decimal places

float numOne
float numTwo
float numThree

numOne = Get next input
numTwo = Get next input
numThree = Get next input

//X to the power of y works
Put RaiseToPower(numOne, numTwo) to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

//2nd Raise works
Put RaiseToPower(numOne, RaiseToPower(numTwo, numThree)) to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

//Absolute val works
Put AbsoluteValue(numOne) to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

Put SquareRoot(RaiseToPower((numOne * numTwo), numThree)) to output with 5 decimal places
