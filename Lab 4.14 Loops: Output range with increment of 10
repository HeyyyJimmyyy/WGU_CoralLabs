//Write a program that reads two integers as input, and outputs the first integer and subsequent increments of 10 as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

// 2 inputs
integer inputOne
integer inputTwo
integer increm

inputOne = Get next input
inputTwo = Get next input

if inputTwo < inputOne
   Put "Second integer can't be less than the first." to output

while inputOne <= inputTwo
   Put inputOne  to output
   Put " " to output
   inputOne = inputOne + 10
