//Write a program that reads a list of 10 integers, and outputs those integers in reverse. For coding simplicity, follow each output integer by a space, including the last one. Then, output a newline.

integer array(6) userInt
integer i
integer max

for i = 0; i < 6; i = i + 1
   userInt[i] = Get next input
   
for i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1
   if userInt[i] <= userInt[5]
      Put userInt[i] to output
      Put " " to output
      
Put "\n" to output
